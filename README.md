#Calculator

This code creates a basic calculator web app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Here are the key things it does:

- Sets up the HTML document structure with head and body tags
- Imports a CSS stylesheet file for styling
- Imports a JavaScript file containing the calculator logic
- Creates a table to layout the calculator display and buttons
- Displays a textbox for showing the calculation input/output 
- Has buttons for numbers, operators, clear, decimal point etc. 
- Calls JavaScript functions when buttons are clicked to show them in the textbox (show())
- Has functions like clear() to clear the textbox
- Has an = button to evaluate the calculation (answer())

So in summary, it:

- Creates the front-end web structure for a calculator 
- Accepts input through calculator buttons 
- Connects the buttons to JavaScript functions
- Performs calculations and displays output dynamically

It leverages HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to make it interactive and functional as a web-based calculator app.
